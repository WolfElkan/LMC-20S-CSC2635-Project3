# Project 3: Interfaces

The files in this repository constitute our submission (still in progress) for [Project 3](https://landmark.instructure.com/courses/2657/assignments/52587) for Computer Science II, Section A, taught by [Dr. Karina Assiter](https://github.com/assiterk).  This project demonstrates our understanding of the concepts taught in the most recent module, including **interfaces**, and other topics.  

## Running the Project

This project will be designed with the goal of being intuitive enough for the user to be able to compile and run it without the need for a demonstration by the students.  If you are not able to make it perform as required, we will be happy to demo it in class as well.

1. Compile the file `Project3.java`.  This will create several new files including `Project3.class`.  
2. Execute the file `Project3.class`.
3. Follow the prompts in terminal.

## Summary Questions

Here are our answers to the Summary Questions provided in the file `Project 3 - Interfaces.docx` which accompanied the assignment.

### Explain the difference between an interface and an abstract class.  
### Why couldnâ€™t MessageEncoder and MessageDecoder have been abstract classes instead of interfaces?
### Describe how you approached and solved the problem(s). 
### Where did you have trouble? How did you move forward? What topics still confuse you? 
### What did you learn from this assignment? (be specific)
### If you worked in pairs, how did divide up the work?
